NOTE: This is a project that started recently, only a small part is implemented. Not ready yet for a production application.

NOTICE: First support for the semantic structure of the keyword "module".
Module supports nested combination of modules and everything you need.
You can do a basic test.

NOTICE: Added support for single line comments and multiple.
NOTICE: Added support for enums.

I am currently developing on Monodevelop 2.8, ANTLRWorks to generate the parser code and integrated NUnit Monodevelop for unit testing.
When running the   Monodevelop 2.6 project did not work for a failure of Monodevelop with NUnit that escapes my hands. Creating an application project for testing would be implemented in this version.
#

Analyzes WebIDL source for semantic tree.
The original idea is to use it to generate source code ScriptSharp interfaces for DOM.
I found many people who consulted in search of a similar program and found nothing.
Anyway, the project is not usable but over the days will go running.
